# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
Perform an exploratary analysis for a ride sharing app, Pyber. Create serval types of visualization to tell a compelling story about the data. Writing Python scripts using Panda's library, Jupyter notebook, and Matplotlib to create variety of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city, and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of the total fares, drivers and riders by type of city. The analysis and visualization will help Pyber improve access to ride-sharing services and determine addordablity for underserved neighborhoods.

- Import your data into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Merge your DataFrames.
- Create a bubble chart that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.
- Determine the mean, median, and mode for the following:
  - The total number of rides for each city type.
  - The average fares for each city type.
  - The total number of drivers for each city type.
- Create box-and-whisker plots that visualize each of the following to determine if there are any outliers:
  - The number of rides for each city type.
  - The fares for each city type.
  - The number of drivers for each city type.
- Create a pie chart that visualizes each of the following data for each city type:
  - The percent of total fares.
  - The percent of total rides.
  - The percent of total drivers.

- Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
- Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type

## Pyber Analysis Results
### Summary Table - PyBer by City Type (Early 2019)
![summary table](analysis/PyBer_summary_table.png)
- Total Riders
  Urban has the most riders compare to Suburban and Rural. It's 68.4% from total riders. 
- Total Drivers
  Urban has the most drivers compare to other city. But it shows a unique relationship where Urban is the only city that has drivers more than riders. 
- Total Fares
  62.7% of the fares is generated by Urban, which is the highest. And followed by Suburban with 30.5% and Rual with 6.8%.
- Average Fare per Ride and per Driver
  Rural has the highest fare in both result. There might be two possible reason:
  1. Each ride is longer in Rural
  2. Lack on driver leading in a higher fare.
  This can be proof by looking at the ratio between total riders and drivers. Every drivers in Rural has to serve 1.6 riders, Surburban is 1.27 riders, and Urban is 0.67 riders.
